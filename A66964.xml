            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>And he ſaith p. 189.—<hi>That be doth not deny, that there are doubtful and controverted places, but</hi> [denies] <hi>that the ſenſe of Scripture is ſo doubtful and obſcure in the things which are neceſſary to mens ſalvation, that perſons without an infallible Guide cannot know the meaning of them.</hi> And again—<hi>We do not deny, that there are places of great difficulty in the Books of Scripture, but we aſſert, that the neceſſaries to Salvation do not ly therein.</hi> And afterward—<hi>If a perſon then by reading and conſidering thoſe things</hi> [believe and] <hi>do what Chriſt requires for his ſalvation, what neceſſity hath ſuch a one to trouble himſelf about an infallible Guide?</hi> I add; or about <hi>any</hi> Guide at all, as to ſuch matters? For, where one <hi>knows</hi> a thing once, no Guide (fallible or infallible) is neceſſary for his <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> that thing. And if an infallible Guide is not neceſſary here, it muſt be becauſe a perſon may know the certain ſenſe of ſuch Scriptures without him: but, if he knows the certain ſenſe without ſuch a Guide, ſo may he without any Guide fallible alſo; for the fallibility of a Guide ſurely doth not render the Scripture more certainly knowable by him, than an infallibility doth: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch caſe neither is a fallible Guide neceſſary.</p>

And, if it be ſaid; though not to the juſt endeavourer, yet to ſuch others as will not uſe their own endeavour ſuch Guides may be needful or uſeful for directing them in neceſſaries; ſo alſo I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will be a Guide <hi>infallible,</hi> that ſo ſuch may not <hi>err</hi> in neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after their having conſulted them. <hi>Ibid.</hi> I find him excuſing himſelf, that in the Principles he drew up, <hi>he no where mentions theſe due helps of our Guides, becauſe his buſineſs was only about the Foundation of Faith, and whether Infallibility was neceſſary for that, or no.</hi> But then, he ought to ſpeak nothing for the excluding Infallibility, that doth alſo exclude as well ſuch due helps. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as he mentions, in his laying this foundation of faith, <hi>a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere endeavour,</hi> ſo ought he any <hi>other</hi> helps, without which, as well as without a ſincere endeavour, he holds the underſtanding of Scripture, though clear, cannot be had.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>18</label> Again, p. 274, he ſaith that—<hi>If all thoſe things which are neceſſary to ſalvation are plain in Scripture to all that ſincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to underſtand them, it doth not hence follow that there can be no juſt authority in a Church, no uſe of perſons, to inſtruct others</hi> [but he ſaith not to inſtruct them in theſe <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> already plain to them]. So he asks there—<hi>If he ſhould ſay that the neceſſary rules for a mans health are ſo plainly laid down by</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>that every one, that will take the pains, may underſtand them, doth this make the whole Profeſſion of Phyſick uſeleſs?</hi> To which who would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Yes; as to ſuch perſon, taking ſuch pains, for his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the neceſſary <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>health;</hi> but not therefore uſeleſs as to all <hi>other</hi> things? P. 275. I find him diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries to Salvation and to Government;</hi> and granting, that for <hi>Church-Government</hi> theſe Guides are neceſſary. But meanwhile <hi>N.

               <p>In all this I find no neceſſity of a Clergy for guiding Chriſtians in neceſſaries; and, if there be, ſhould he not have mentioned the conſulting them, (if it were but for the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>

'Next; the Dr. denies not, that theſe Church-Governours may rightly underſtand all neceſſaries upon a ſincere endeavour; nor, that a ſincere endeavour is uſed by them.

               <p>To prove which, a thing that ſeems of it ſelf evident, it is enough to ſay, it hath that <hi>moral certainty</hi> in it which generally Church-Tradition is ſaid to have; <hi>viz.</hi> that ſo many ſuch perſons cannot conſpire in ſuch a matter, <hi>viz.</hi> a neceſſary to ſalvation, to falſify the truth, againſt their own belief and conſcience, to all their Subjects, and to Poſterity; with an <hi>Anathema</hi> to all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters; when themſelves alſo are ſuch.

Theſe <hi>Judges</hi> were appointed by God to decide the true <hi>Senſe</hi> of the Law not of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but of <hi>God,</hi> given to <hi>Moſes;</hi> and all perſons obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the ſenſe they gave of it; and to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>forbear</hi> to practiſe as they (fallible, or infallible) ſtated ſuch matter to be commanded or prohibited by it; and that upon pain of death. This Obedience let <hi>Proteſtants</hi> yield to lawful <hi>General Councils;</hi> more is not deſired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> (11) <hi>Doth this imply infallibility? No, that he dares not ſtand to, but abſolute obedience.</hi> I think the Dr grants here, the people yielded <hi>abſolute</hi> obedience to theſe <hi>Judges: i.e,</hi> I ſuppoſe, <hi>aſſent</hi> to their ſentence, deciding to them what was the true ſenſe of Gods Law; which is all <hi>N.

Do the people then the ſame to the Judges in <hi>Weſtminſter?</hi> i.e. hold themſelves obliged to do whatever theſe tell them is lawful, or commanded, I mean by God's law? Let him review here what he hath ſaid in his <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Account,</hi> if he pleaſeth, p. 239. to the contrary; allowing an obligation to <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> or <hi>acquieſcence,</hi> but not an obligation in <hi>conſcience:</hi> and, if he pleaſe too, that which Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi>

We are bound to obey the ſentence of the Judge, or not to reſiſt it; but not always to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it juſt. But in matters of Religion ſuch a Judge is required, whom we ſhould be obliged to believe to have judged right. So that in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106776:73"/>civil controverſies every honeſt underſtanding man is fit to be a Judge; but in Religion none but he that is infallible</hi> [at leaſt in all <hi>neceſſary</hi> matters]. Thus he.</p>

Doth not this Author, of the two ways to prove it named juſt before, allow either of them ſufficient? Now ſee this latter proved before in Note on p. 113. l. 17. and ſo I hope we may peaceably take leave of <hi>Miracles.</hi>

I ſuppoſe, whence other Proteſtants do: <hi>viz.</hi> from the Promiſe of our Lord in Scripture, that <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt his</hi> Church. See Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd</hi> p. 140.—<hi>That the whole Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cannot err in doctrines abſolutely fundamental ſeems to me to be clear by the promiſe of Chriſt</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>That the gates of hell</hi> &amp;c. [And it is as clear, that the Arch-biſhop meant it not only of a number of <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> as our Author doth here; but, of true <hi>Paſtors</hi> alſo and <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church.] If this <hi>Promiſe</hi> then be enough for believing of this, the non-failing of Chriſtians that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106776:73"/>ſhall believe all neceſſary truth without <hi>Miracles;</hi> will it not, ſuppoſing ſuch a promiſe made to them, be as ſufficient for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the other, the indefectibility of the Church-Guides as to teaching all neceſſary faith, without their <hi>doing Miracles?</hi>

                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> 16. <hi>But, in caſe any perſons challenge an infallibility to themſelves antecedently to the belief of Scriptures</hi> &amp;c, <hi>ſuch perſons are equally bound to prove their infallibility by Miracles as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were.</hi> What if they challenge this Infallibility like wiſe from the Scriptures; as moſt certainly they do? This latter challenge of theirs, ſurely, will ſuperſede <hi>Miracles.</hi> But let us ſuppoſe no ſuch challenge. What thinks he, if they produce the evidence of <hi>Tradition</hi> for their Infallibility antecedently to <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as alſo they do? Is not this (we here ſuppoſe there is ſuch a Tradition, which is proved before<note n="‖" place="margin">Note on p. <hi>113.</hi> l. <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note>) a ſufficiently clear and ſelf-evident proof of it? If not of their <hi>Infallibility;</hi> how then is the ſame <hi>Tradition,</hi> without <hi>Miracles,</hi> a ſufficient proof to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of the <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Suppoſe the ſame promiſes made &amp; no Scriptures written, would not the Catholick Church have been, what it is? and, muſt it then have perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-ſhewn Miracles, or no Infallibility as to Neceſſaries have been believed in it?</p>

Yet ſuch Miracles were neceſſary then to more perſons than thoſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who made the very <hi>firſt</hi> Sermons concerning the Goſpel; becauſe the bare Tradition of a few at the firſt was not ſo evidently credible, as that which by many Sermons made, and Miracles done, in many places, afterward became <hi>

                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> (4.) <hi>All the Miracles pretended among them ſignify nothing to our preſent purpoſe; unleſs theſe miracles give evidence of the authority, and infallibility, of thoſe, by whom they were done.</hi> Here I ſay; Firſt, that there is no neceſſity of evidencing now the <hi>Church's Authority,</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi> by <hi>Miracles.</hi> 2ly, That <hi>true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> I mean, ſuch, as our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, <hi>the giving ſight to the blind, raiſing the dead,</hi> &amp;c, eſpecially if there be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a like frequency and proof or evidence of them, are done only in the Catholick Church (where alſo the <hi>Frequency</hi> of <hi>them</hi> produceth that firm belief, by the ſatisfaction and conviction of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by ſome or other of theſe miracles, that are either ſeen by them, or by ſuch as were preſent are confirmed to them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſome <hi>ſingle Facts</hi> in other falſe <hi>Religions,</hi> that are rarely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be done, and in ſome remote times, and ſo are deſtitute of any ſuch evidence of atteſtation, or diſcovery of their truth, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not effect). And that ſuch Miracles as theſe are not done (for any <hi>end</hi> whatever) elſwhere by <hi>Heathens,</hi> or by <hi>Hereticks.</hi> For, if ſuch Miracles, no way diſtinguiſhable or diverſified from thoſe of our Lord or his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were ſeen to be really done by falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions as <hi>well</hi> and as <hi>uſually</hi> as in the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> the <hi>End,</hi> wherefore done, would be a thing of the greateſt <hi>uncertainty;</hi> and moſt eaſily miſtaken, or miſrelated: and, after the <hi>Clear evidence</hi> of ſuch Miracles done there, this <hi>end</hi> would be repreſented by every <hi>Religion</hi> to their own advantage, as they pleaſed; and thus <hi>all</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106776:75"/>would come to have an undiſcernably equal Plea of their <hi>Confirmation</hi> by <hi>Miracles.</hi> Therefore in the Scripture we finde not the <hi>End,</hi> why the Miracle was done, chiefly inſiſted on or proved to the people, (Yet the clearing of which <hi>End,</hi> in ſuch caſe of <hi>all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions</hi> doing the ſame <hi>True</hi> Miracles, were the thing the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary) but the <hi>Fact;</hi> and from it preſently gathered the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickneſs, and the Divine approbation, of the <hi>Perſon.</hi> See <hi>John.</hi> 9.16, 17, 30, 31, 33. <hi>Such</hi> and <hi>ſo well atteſted</hi> Miracles therefore as our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did I gather never have been, never ſhall be, done by any perſons in <hi>falſe Religion,</hi> or that are no members of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church. 3. And then, this granted, I may hence ſafely conclude alſo, that ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> do always evidence the Church wherein they are done to be the <hi>Catholick,</hi> and ſo that Church, to which our Lords Promiſes of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as to all <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,</hi> do belong. Add to this; that, if any <hi>True Miracles</hi> can be ſhewn in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Dr's words following ſeem to make good its <hi>Infallibility:</hi>—<hi>For</hi> (ſaith he<note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 121. <hi>l.</hi> 1.</note>) <hi>they would do well to ſhew, where, ever in Scripture God did beſtow a gift of Miracles upon any, but for this end,</hi> [i.e. <hi>to give evidence of the Authority and Infallibility, thoſe by whom they were done</hi>]; <hi>and what reaſon there is, that God ſhould alter the method and courſe of his Providence, in a matter of ſo great concernment to the Faith of Mankind.</hi> So he. If then God never beſtows a gift of Miracles for any other end, ſave this; then, if <hi>true Miracles</hi> ſuch as our <hi>Lord's</hi> be proved, <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> alſo is proved, to be in the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>But, to reflect on theſe words of his,—[<hi>They would do well to ſhew,</hi> &amp;c.], a litle further. If our Author means here, by the <hi>Miracle's</hi> ſhewing the <hi>infallibility</hi> of the Worker, ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had in delivering nothing by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but <hi>Gods word</hi> and the Dictates of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> I can ſhew him in Scripture many, that were the Inſtruments of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and had not <hi>this;</hi> as thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> and others in the Apoſtles times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10, 28, 30. God beſtowing this Gift on ſeveral others there, beſides the Apoſtles, who had not an <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. Of all which holy perſons, whom God honours thus with Miracles, though it may be ſaid, that, what ſuch deliver for <hi>Gods Faith,</hi> certainly <hi>is</hi> ſo, (who otherwiſe would never be aſſiſted with <hi>Miracles,</hi> [which are alwaies a ſeale of <hi>truth</hi>] if delivering <hi>falſityes</hi> as Divine truths); Yet it cannot be ſaid of <hi>them</hi> as of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> that whatever they deliver is Gods Truth, whilſt, in their delivering it, they do not pretend it ſo; as the Apoſtles did ſo pretend it; and therefore, upon doing <hi>Miracles,</hi> were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in ſuch their <hi>pretenſion.</hi> But, if thoſe whom God honours
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106776:76"/>with miracles are to be believed in what they ſay, then cannot their Miracles be urged for an infallibility in all they ſhall teach or hold, who do themſelves <hi>ſay</hi> and <hi>profeſſe</hi> the contrary. Their Miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and make good what they pretend to, but not more. I ſay then, if the Dr means here: That whoever have the gift of doing Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles have likewiſe ſuch an infallibility in all they ſay, as was in the Apoſtles, it holds not true. For, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> alſo had ſuch a Gift who were not in ſuch a manner infallible. But, if He means here, that none have had this Gift or done any ſuch <hi>evident</hi> and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Miracles,</hi> but ſuch only as have taught or held the <hi>infallible Catholick faith</hi> as to all the <hi>neceſſary</hi> points thereof; (the faith, I ſay, which being entirely delivered by the Apoſtles there is no further need of infallibility like to that of theirs, for conveying the ſame as it was received from them to poſterity), I accord with him; and contend, that none to this day have had ſuch <hi>Gift,</hi> ſave ſuch <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi> perſons: No <hi>Pagans,</hi> no <hi>Hereticks:</hi> true Miracles ſuch as our Lord and his Apoſtles did being diſtinctive ſignes that accompany and follow only true Believers according to our Lord's promiſe <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.17. for whatever <hi>Ends</hi> theſe Miracles happen to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; as they may be for many, beſides the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> Therefore, where a Frequency of true Miracles is ſeen in any Communion, we may ſafely follow the profeſſion of its Faith: God having provided, that his <hi>Catholick Church</hi> and <hi>true Miracles</hi> ſhall never be parted; <hi>i.e.</hi> that, where the latter are, there is the former. By <hi>True Miracles</hi> I mean ſuch (though it needs not to be, all ſuch) as our Lord and his Apoſtles did; and ſo clearly teſtified by <hi>Eye-Witneſſes,</hi> as their's were or might be. And I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude here all ſuch effects, though <hi>miraculous</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> as <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> God permitting, have a power to effect by the inſtrumency and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, ſuch miracles, I willingly grant both <hi>Magicians</hi> and alſo <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> may operate by the aſſiſtance of theſe Angelical powers therein; either Voluntary, or alſo conſtrained as to the inferiour ſort of theſe Spirits compelled thereto by their Superiours.

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 121. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>Such Miracles as were wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles we defy all other Religions in the world to produce any like them, to confirm their Doctrine.</hi> i.e. As one may underſtand him; Neither <hi>Heathens,</hi> neither <hi>Heretical</hi> Churches can ever do any ſuch Miracles as were wrought by our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106776:76"/>viz.</hi> give <hi>ſight</hi> to the <hi>blind,</hi> cure the <hi>ſick,</hi> raiſe again the <hi>dead,</hi> &amp;c. From which it follows, that whatever Church doth ſuch Miracles muſt be the Catholick; &amp; from this, that ſuch Miracles whereever they are found in any age, do ſhew the Church wherein they are done to be Infallible in Neceſſaries; for ſo the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is. But, if here he puts in the laſt words [<hi>to confirm their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>] as limiting the former, and carrying ſuch a ſenſe, that other Religions, beſide the Catholick, may alſo do all ſuch Miracles as our Lord and his Apoſtles did for ſome other <hi>ends;</hi> but not for this, viz. <hi>to confirm their doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> I think he will have an hard task of it, either * to ſhew, that the <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> that have related ſuch miracles have not alſo applied them to the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> that ſuch Heathen or Heretical Miracle-workers profeſſed, and of the <hi>Honour</hi> of thoſe <hi>Gods,</hi> they ſerved [ſuppoſe thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> or <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> or <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus,</hi> or of the <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Donatiſt</hi>-Biſhops; who urged them againſt S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> for a juſtification of their <hi>ſect</hi> and orthodoxneſs of their doctrine]. Or, on the other ſide, * to ſhew; that thoſe, who have related our Lord's and his Apoſtle's Miracles, have, to give theſe their juſt force and value, expreſſed alwaies that they were done to this <hi>end</hi> the Dr mentions here; and not to ſome other ends, from which conſequently nothing could be concluded concerning the <hi>truth</hi> of their <hi>doctrine:</hi> Of which <hi>end</hi> of them therefore it concerned the world chiefly to be informed; not of the <hi>fact:</hi> Or * to ſhew, that our <hi>Lord</hi> or his Apoſtles alwaies clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this to be their end, to their Auditors and ſpectatours; which was in the firſt place neceſſary to be done. But the people we ſee, without examining this, argued the men to be from God from their beholding the Miracles done: And the Phariſees, not dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the neceſſity of ſuch a circumſtance, never offered to elude any of our Lords Miracles (as for example that done upon the blind man. <hi>Jo.</hi> 9.) alledging them to be done not in confirmation of his doctrine, but upon ſome other by-account, and ſo, as they might poſſibly be done alſo in a <hi>falſe Religion;</hi> and ſo his <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be rendred no way more <hi>creditable</hi> thereby.</p>

So we find early in <hi>Geneſis</hi> mention of ſeveral laws committed afterward to writing by <hi>Moſes,</hi> See before Note on. p. 85. <hi>l.</hi> 14.

In the beſt times of Chriſtianity.</hi> But do not you then in <hi>all</hi> times? Or, is not their authority the <hi>ſame</hi> in all times? If various, who is <hi>Judge</hi> of this, their <hi>Subjects?—As an excellent means to underſtand &amp;c.</hi> This will not ſerve the turn; it muſt be as an <hi>authorized Expoſitor</hi> of the true ſenſe of Scriptures doubtful and obſcure in Neceſſary matters, to whoſe definitions all ought to <hi>ſubmit;</hi> not only, to make uſe of their <hi>advice.</hi> This <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> makes good: this ſuch Proteſtants as our Author op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>

                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> 13. <hi>We reject the ancient Hereſies condemned in them.</hi> But doth he acknowledge and reject <hi>all</hi> that as <hi>Hereſy,</hi> that hath been or ſhall be condemned by <hi>all</hi> lawful General Councils for ſuch?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> (11). <hi>We reject nothing, that can be proved by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition from the Apoſtolical times downwards. That can be proved.</hi> But who ſhall judge of the <hi>proof,</hi> where any thing is diſputed, whether it be <hi>Tradition; Apoſtolick?</hi> Our ſelves, or the preſent Church-Governours?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> (5) <hi>We ſee no reaſon to have thoſe things forced upon us now, which we offer to prove to be contrary to their</hi> [the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times] <hi>doctrine and practice. Offer to prove:</hi> To whom? To any whoſe <hi>final judgment</hi> you will ſtand to? Name them. Shall it be to a <hi>General Council?</hi> But, this may err you ſay. It erring, ſhall it be to a <hi>Second?</hi> But, if <hi>one</hi> err, ſo may <hi>all.</hi> And who ſhall judge when It doth not err? <hi>Demonſtration</hi> ſhall decide it.

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 149. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>The Controverſy is, Whether the Guides of the Apoſtolical and Primitive times ought not to have greater authority over us, than thoſe of the preſent Church in things wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict each other?</hi> Here again, who ſhall <hi>judge</hi> this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence concerning their <hi>contradiction,</hi> denied by <hi>Catholicks,</hi> denied by the <hi>latter Councils</hi> of the Church; that plead <hi>Tradition,</hi> and their agreement with the <hi>former.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> 8. <hi>But we profeſs to yield greater reverence and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mind to Chriſt and his Apoſtles than to any Guides of the Church ever ſince: we are ſure they ſpake by an infallible Spirit, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106776:87"/>where they have determined matters of faith &amp; practice, we look upon it as arrogance &amp; preſumption in any others, to alter what they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. Where they have determined matters of faith or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> But who's Judge of this, what Chriſt and his Apoſtles have determined? the <hi>Church's Councils;</hi> or <hi>private men,</hi> each for himſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> (13). <hi>Til ignorance, ambition, private intereſts, ſwayed too much among thoſe, who were called the Guides.</hi> Theſe vices in all ages are found in ſome; and are juſtly by others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. But doth He charge theſe on the Church's <hi>Supremeſt</hi> Guides or its <hi>General</hi> Councils? Then, if we declining their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on this <hi>account,</hi> to what other <hi>Courts</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> will He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us to apply our ſelves, that are <hi>more free?</hi> what private Perſon or inferior Court?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> (3). <hi>In matters impoſed upon us to believe or practiſe, which are repugnant to plain commands of Scripture or the evidence of ſenſe or the Grounds of Chriſtian Religion, no Authority of the preſent Guides of a Church is to overrule our faith or practice. In things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plain commands of Scripture, or grounds of Religion;</hi> we join with him, <hi>No Church-authority is to overrule our faith or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> But, the former Queſtion ſtill returns, Who ſhall judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us what is, or is not ſo contrary? As for the other thing he mentions <hi>[contrary to the evidence of ſenſe]:</hi> If a <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be contrary to ſuch <hi>evidence,</hi> I hope, our Faith is to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and, for this I think I have the Dr's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in theſe words in his <hi>Rational Account.</hi> Where diſcourſing of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> whether conſiſtent with the grounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, he ſaith<note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 567</note> —<hi>That which I am now upon is not how far reaſon</hi> [I ſuppoſe he will allow me to ſay, or ſenſe] <hi>is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Divine authority, in caſe of certainty that there is a Divine Revelation for what I am to believe; but how far it is to be renounced</hi> [that is Reaſon, or Senſe] <hi>when all evidence that is brought</hi> [i.e. for ſuch a Divine Revelation] <hi>is from the authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. So that that Queſtion in ſhort is, Whether there be greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I am bound to believe the Fathers in a matter contrary to Senſe and Reaſon or elſe to adhere to the judgment of them, though in oppoſition to the Father's authority?</hi> Where I underſtand him to ſay; that he is to believe a <hi>Divine</hi> Revelation, that is <hi>certainly</hi> ſuch, made known to him by <hi>one</hi> Senſe, the <hi>Hearing;</hi> though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perceptions of <hi>another</hi> Senſe the Seeing: but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, that he is ſtill rather to adhere to the <hi>judgment</hi> of his <hi>Senſes,</hi> than credit the <hi>Fathers</hi> concerning the truth of ſuch a Divine Revelation, as contradicts his Senſes. So The <hi>certainty</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:106776:87"/>of the <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> is here the only thing in queſtion; which once any way proved the evidence <hi>Senſe</hi> gives-in againſt it is to be neglected. Now, of the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> or of the true ſenſe of Scripture we reckon the unanimous conſent of the <hi>Fathers</hi> or Primitive Church (if ſuch can be ſhewn) ſo <hi>expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> it, a ſufficient proof. And I think ſometimes ſo doth Dr <hi>St.</hi> in theſe words <hi>Rat. Account</hi> p. 375.—<hi>We profeſs to be guided by the ſenſe of Scripture at interpreted by the unanimous conſent of the Fathers, and the four firſt General Councils.</hi> And p. 56.—<hi>It is a ſufficient preſcription againſt any thing that can be alledged out of Scripture, that it ought not to be looked on as the true meaning of the Scripture, if it appears contrary to the ſenſe of the Catholick Church from the beginning.</hi> And ſo, laying the <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi> here aſide, what <hi>their</hi> conſent is, is the firſt thing to be diſcuſſed.</p>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 150. <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>For there are ſome things ſo plain that no man wilbe guided by anothers opinion in them.</hi> Catholicks wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly allow withdrawing <hi>obedience</hi> where you have <hi>Certainty.</hi> But how vainly doth any one pretend or promiſe himſelf a certainty of any thing, wherein a General Council, or a much major part of the Church, having all the ſame means of certainty as he, judgeth contrary: or fancy that ſuch a matter carrieth the like evidence to perſons, as doth the Whiteneſs of Snow?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ib. l.</hi> 12. <hi>I am certain, if I deſtroy the evidence of Senſe, I muſt overthrow the grounds of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> What, if I disbelieve Senſe only in ſuch a particular thing, where <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> declares the contrary?

For Example, that the <hi>Metropolitan Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> owes no ſubjection to the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Church, of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor to the Pope, as the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> thereof. And the other <hi>three</hi> owe him no <hi>ſubjection</hi> neither as he is Patriarch of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> but the <hi>fourth</hi> doth; and yielded it together with other Occidental Churches, till of late. But, meanwhile, the Eaſtern Churches, are agreed, that they owe all ſubjection and ſubmiſſion of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106776:94"/>more to be neceſſary, than that this evidence, received either from all, or only ſome of theſe Notes (to thoſe who have not ability to examine others) be ſuch, as that it outweigh any arguments moving him to the contrary; and ſuch, as the like evidence is thought ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine us in other Elections. And then, this Church thus being found, he may be reſolved by it concerning the ſenſe of other Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more dubious, and generally touching all other difficulties to him in Religion: to wit, ſo far as this Church, from time to time, ſeeth a neceſſity of ſuch Reſolution, and the Divine Revelation therein is to her ſufficiently clear; only if ſuch perſon, not ſpending ſo much of his own Judgment, will afford, in stead of it, a little more of his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And thus, p. 81.—<hi>In caſe theſe Guides</hi> [Perſons, or Churches; for, both have a ſubordination] <hi>ſhall diſagree, yet every Chriſtian may eaſily know, whoſe judgments among them he ought to follow: namely always of that Church-authority, that is the Superiour, which in moſt caſes is indiſputable; this Eccleſiaſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being placed by the Divine Providence in an exact Subordination. As here in</hi> England <hi>it is not doubted, whether we are to pay our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience rather to a National Synod than to a Dioceſan; to the Arch-Biſhop, or Primate, than to an ordinary Biſhop, or Presbyter: And then, he who hath ſome experience in Church-affairs, if willing to take ſuch a courſe, cannot but diſcerne, what way the major part of Chriſtendome, and its higher and more comprehenſive Councils, that have hitherto been, do guide him.</hi> And the more <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>ignorant,</hi> who ſo can come know nothing better, ought to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the more <hi>experienced.</hi> See below Note on p. 251. l. 8 n. 6.</p>

                     <hi>but that the ſenſe of Scripture is ſo doubtful and obſcure in the things which are neceſſary to mens ſalvation, that perſons without an infallible Guide cannot know the meaning of them.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Why it lies more upon <hi>N.O.</hi> to prove, that the ſenſe of Scripture is not clear as to <hi>ſome</hi> perſons, in <hi>ſome</hi> points neceſſary, than on the Dr to prove, that the Scripture is clear to them in <hi>all</hi> points neceſſary, I ſee not: ſince he <hi>affirms</hi> theſe plain to all, <hi>N.O.</hi> denies it, and Affirmers, as he ſaith<note n="‖" place="margin">

Then what thinks he of his own words <hi>Ration. Account</hi> p. 58. urged by <hi>N.O.</hi> p. 63. and cited before in Note on p. 126. l. 2. <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Chriſt.</hi> and <hi>the Trinity,</hi> are they not points neceſſary to be rightly believed for attaining Salvation? And Doth not the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Church-Governours <hi>ſet over</hi> the Church by <hi>God</hi> Eph. 4.11.13. relate to Neceſſaries? Or, where the erring of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned</hi> (which always many Chriſtians muſt be 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) tends to mens <hi>deſtruction,</hi> is not the <hi>knowing</hi> of the right ſenſe <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to their <hi>ſalvation?</hi> What thinks he of the ſenſe of <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> urged by <hi>N.O.</hi> p. 20? Is it clear on the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſide to all uſing a juſt endeavour, when the much major part of Chriſtianity, (and, before <hi>Luther's</hi> time, the <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or, is the true ſenſe of this Text not neceſſary to be known, where ſuch a groſs <hi>Idolatry</hi> is affirmed by our Author to be the neceſſary conſequent of an <hi>erroneous</hi> ſenſe?</p>
                  <p>But, if he will reſtrain Neceſſaries to the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> or perhaps only to three or four principal Articles thereof, the pure neſcience of which excludes from ſalvation; then, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106776:102"/>theſe are clear in Scripture, ſo why will he not allow, that <hi>General Councils</hi> are in theſe <hi>infallible,</hi> and ſo the Church in <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries</hi> an Infallible Guide?</p>
                  <p>But then let him conſider, in any ſuch reſtraint of <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> yet whether there are not many other points at leaſt ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>beneficial</hi> to ſalvation, as that the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> is engaged to leave the <hi>truth</hi> of them alſo either clear to all ſober enquirers in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or to <hi>Guides,</hi> that ſhall not err in expounding ſuch Scriptures to the people. Indeed, after ſo much clamour againſt the pernicious doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> our Author ſeems to have a hard task of it, and alſo very unſutable to ſo much choler, to maintain that none of the points agitated between it, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is ſo neceſſary, (for attaining ſalvation at leaſt with leſs difficulty), to be believed on the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſide, that God ſhould either leave <hi>Scripture</hi> for it clear enough to the ſober enquirer; or elſe, in the ſenſe of Scripture <hi>doubtful,</hi> ſome living <hi>Guide</hi> unerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to determine it. Or, if he ſhall ſay, God hath left <hi>Scriptures clear</hi> to all capacities well-endeavouring in <hi>all ſuch</hi> points; he ſeems to have as hard a task again to maintain this; when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of Chriſtianity, reading theſe Scriptures, do think, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, the contrary to be clear in them. But laſtly; if what He over-laviſheth in the <hi>plainneſs</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> to all well endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring capacities and conditions, he will make an amends for now in the <hi>reſtraining</hi> of <hi>Neceſſaries;</hi> On whoſe Judgment, I pray, is it fit a particular perſon ſhould rely in this Queſtion, which ſeems of great concernment, <hi>What</hi> or <hi>how many</hi> points are to be called <hi>Neceſſary?</hi> On Mr <hi>Chilling worth's</hi> or the <hi>Dr's?</hi> Or on that of the Supreme <hi>Guides</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> aſſembled in her General Councils, who from time to time declare to Chriſtians by their Decrees, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did in the firſt <hi>General Council,</hi> Act. 15. what is Neceſſary for them to believe, what to practiſe, againſt all ſuch <hi>erroneous</hi> Tenents as ſhall ariſe in the <hi>Church,</hi> that may any way pervert their <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Manners?</hi>

For, in this firſt means, no repairing at all to our <hi>Spiritual Guides</hi> fallible or infallible, for the ſenſe is mentioned. 2ly. I grant, that there is a means of attaining a ſufficient certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſenſe of ſome <hi>obſcure</hi> places of Scripture from others more <hi>clear,</hi> without the neceſſity of any other infallible Guide therein; and that the <hi>Fathers</hi> alſo have laid down many excellent <hi>Rules</hi> concerning this and practiſed them, in diſputing againſt Hereticks. 3ly. The <hi>more,</hi> and the <hi>more certain</hi> theſe means are for knowing the ſenſe of Scripture, the more they ſeem to inferr the <hi>Infallibility</hi> and non-erring of the Supreme Governours of the Church met in Council <hi>herein,</hi> and the more ſecurity of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject's, as to all neceſſary faith, relying on their Judgment. Nor do I ſee any thing that can be replied here; but, That theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours <hi>well knowing</hi> the right ſenſe of Scriptures, yet by <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, intereſt,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>paſſions</hi> may be corrupted from <hi>teaching</hi> it; and alſo may be induced to define as an Article of their Faith to all poſterity the contrary <hi>falſhoods;</hi> and themſelves alſo firſt take their <hi>Oath</hi> of their <hi>belief</hi> of the truth thereof; which, though a very ſtrange charge, yet might paſs for a more tolerable exception, if thoſe who will <hi>judge</hi> of this ſwerving and erring of Councils were themſelves exempt from any ſuch <hi>paſſions</hi> or <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,</hi> or could well know when they are biaſs'd with them; but otherwiſe it ſeems a very poor ſubterfuge; yet the only one they can alledge for diſobedience to Councils. 4ly. It is here to be remembred, that, if this means by <hi>comparing Scriptures</hi> &amp;c.

Infallibility,</hi> to ruine alſo as much or more <hi>Church-Authority; viz.</hi> as to their office of <hi>Teaching</hi> Chriſts flock and <hi>expounding</hi> to them the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Theſe particular reaſonings of the Dr queſtioned for this, <hi>N.O.</hi> expected, ſhould in an Anſwer to him, have been reſumed by the Dr, and juſtified. But, in the firſt of theſe quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that follow, out of <hi>N.O.</hi> p. 50. he finds our Author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>N O's Conſequence</hi> indeed, but omitting the <hi>Argument</hi> immediately preceding, from which he inferred it; <hi>viz. Firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that whatever Divine aſſiſtance is advanced here</hi> [viz. in the Dr's 19. <hi>Principle</hi>] <hi>againſt the aſſurance that can be received from Church-Infallibility the ſame is more advanced againſt any aſſurance that may be had from Church-Authority;</hi> And ſo Church-Authority as to this matter is thrown off by him as well as Church-Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To this Obſervation the Dr ſaith nothing. In the 2d Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation out of p. 70. he finds him mentioning the <hi>Charge N.O.</hi> layes upon him of juſtly incurring the diſpleaſure of his Eccleſiaſtical Saperiours (as indeed all <hi>Chillingworths</hi> followers ſeeme to do, corrupting ſomthing which formerly remained good in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and, which being good, all good men have reaſon to wiſh well to, and that it may be preſerved there; for, that which is good, ſtill preparing the way to ſomething better, may end at laſt in an happy <hi>reunion</hi> of the divided <hi>Church: hes</hi> and this may ſerve to <hi>anſwer</hi> this Author's <hi>Ironical</hi> deſcant here p. 261.262.); but finds him omitting here to take any notice of <hi>N.O's Reaſon</hi> for it immediatly preceding <hi>viz.</hi>—Here [i.e. in his 29th <hi>Principle</hi>] firſt obſerve: That <hi>what no Chriſtian is obliged to believe under any pretence of Church-Infallibility, he is much rather not obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve under any pretence of Church-Authority: and that the Dr's free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church's ſubjects here</hi> [i.e. as to their believing what theſe Governours teach them] <hi>from the former, doth ſo from the latter.</hi> Thus <hi>N.O.</hi> Neither replies he any thing to this.

Or that, in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning a mans uſing his <hi>endeavour,</hi> this Author involves principally the repairing to his Guides for their inſtruction.
